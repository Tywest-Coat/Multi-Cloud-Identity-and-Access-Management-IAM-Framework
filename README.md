# Multi-Cloud-Identity-and-Access-Management-IAM-Framework
Building a multi-cloud IAM solution using AWS and Azure. Will be showcasing how to implement security policies, role-based access controls (RBACs), and integrating with AWS IAM and Azure Active Directory. Demonstrating how the IAM framework enhances secure access across cloud environments.


Steps:
1. Set up AWS IAM:
  * Create multiple user roles with different permissions (e.g., Admin, Developer, Viewer).
  * Define and attach IAM policies for each role to limit their access to specific resources.

2. Set up Azure Active Directory (AD):
  * Create user roles in Azure AD similar to AWS IAM (e.g., Admin, Developer).
  * Assign role-based access control (RBAC) permissions in Azure to manage resources.

3. Integrate Azure AD with AWS IAM:
  * Set up Azure AD as the identity provider (IdP) for AWS.
  * Use AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) to allow Azure AD users to access AWS resources through a secure, federated login.

4. Implement Cross-Cloud Security Policies:
  * Set up Security Token Service (STS) in AWS to grant short-term, temporary credentials for users from Azure AD.
  * Apply least privilege principles across both clouds to ensure minimal access is granted.

5. Test and Document:
  * Test logins from both AWS and Azure, ensuring users get the correct permissions based on their role.
  * Document the process for setting up cross-cloud IAM and provide any security best practices.
